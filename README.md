# Ruby's Rentals for Riders - a Motorcycle Rental App

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able toâ€¦

- check out a location and see the bikes available at that location
- check out the bikes and look at a specific bike to see more information about it
- put up my own bike to be rented by filling out a form
- edit and remove my bike

## Challenges

- Due to the nature of the many to many relationship and join tables, I initially thought I would be able to simply nest my post route so that i was '/locations/location_id/bikes', but instead found that it had the same functionality as a just posting to bikes.  In order to work around this, I had to make a second fetch request after to the join table and create a new ledger.
- In order to delete a bike, I ran into an issue where I was unable to delete the bike due to the existence of the corresponding ledger, so I had to first delete the ledger using a fetch to first find it, then another to delete the ledger, and then a third to delete the bike.

## What We Would Like To Revisit

- I would love to add user authentication so that each bike is associated to a user, which would prevent users from editing and deleting other users' bikes.
- I had initially planned on using the google maps api to include a map of the location of each "store", but ran out of time to do so and would love to go back and add that in.
